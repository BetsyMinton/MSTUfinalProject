# Final Project SUMMER
Betsy Minton

Main Gist:   This page is designed to help people who have never designed in 3D before.   I tried to make it as interactive as possible where it made sense for the design target.   There are 4 pages in total.  The first and final pages are the key ones with the most original content.  

I am most proud of the survey code on the Software Types page that gives a different result based on input.    I also love the image pop-ups with the image map.  

## Collaboration

Hillary and I chatted some about our projects and I attended the online meeting on Saturday.
